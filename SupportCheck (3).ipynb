      "### Background\n",
      "1. LPDDR 6 will support 32 bits of meta data, that can according to the JEDEC standard be used for system meta data (data written by host, e.g. end-to-end ECC), Link ECC, DBI (Data Bus Inversion)\n",
      "2. DBI is implementing a so-called inversion encoding that helps reducing the number of transitions on the bus which improves power consumption as well as signal integrity\n",
      "3. With the increase of per pin bitrates to values >10,000 MTS, especially the signal integrity improvement is considered as very valuable by customers\n",
      "4. Additionally, Link ECC/EDC is relevant for improved system robustness and error detection – This is important for improved RAS (Reliability, Availability, Serviceability) and FuSa (Functional Safety) in automotive\n",
      "5. The combination table provided on the next page shows that DBI and Link ECC/EDC cannot be performed together\n",
      "\n",
      "### Invention Details\n",
      "1. This invention describes a way, that allows to perform DBI and Link ECC/EDC in parallel\n",
      "2. The idea of this invention is to use the slots reserved for the meta data bits (M0 … M15) to transmit/receive DBI information\n",
      "3. This way, bits L0 … L15 are available to implement Link ECC/EDC\n",
      "4. In the state-of-the-art approach, inversion coding takes place between host memory controller and DRAM, e.g. Write: encoding in host controller, transmit, decoding in DRAM; Read: encoding in DRAM, transmit, decoding in host controller\n",
      "5. In case system meta data bits (M0 … M15) are used to implement inversion encoding, the DBI bits should be stored in the carved-out memory space\n",
      "6. Encoding as well as decoding is done on host controller side: Write: encoding in host controller, transmit, copy DBI bits into carved out memory space; Read: read DBI bits from carved out memory space, transmit, decoding in host controller\n",
      "7. The trade-off of the approach proposed on the previous slide is that other usages of the Meta Data bits are not possible anymore\n",
      "8. This can still be feasible because, for example, Link ECC/EDC with retransmission, array ECC inside the DRAM and other proprietary or standard JEDEC RAS features might already provide enough protection for the DRAM.\n",
      "9. In case a 2nd meta data function (e.g. system ECC/EDC) is still required, it would be possible to split the Meta Data bits (M0 … M15) between bits for the 2nd meta data function and DBI encoding information.\n",
      "10. In the JEDEC implementation, 16 data bits are used to encode 1 DBI bit. To implement bus inversion for all 256 data bits, 16 DBI bits are, hence, required\n",
      "11. In case a 2nd meta data function is required together with inversion encoding, 32 data bits could, for example, encode 1 DBI. Only 8 DBI bits would be needed then, and the remaining 8 bits could be used for a 2nd meta function.\n",
      "12. This can be used in a flexible way, using n bits DBI bits and 16-n bits for the 2nd meta data function\n",
      "\n",
      "### Examples\n",
      "1. Data Burst: 288-bits over 12 pulses (24 Beats or UIs); 256-bits mission data; 32-bits meta data\n",
      "2. Sub-channel 0/1: Meta Function 1: M0 through M15 -> Meta Carve-out Bits; Meta Function 2: L0 through L15 -> Link ECC/EDC / DBI Bits\n",
      "3. System Meta Carve-OUT: System meta data is 1st buffered in registers but can later then copied to a carved-out (reserved) memory space with a special command\n",
      "4. This approach was chosen (vs. a direct write to the array) to save die area\n",
      "5. 16-bits (2B) transfer between internal register and IOs per Read/Write data burst; 256-bits (32B) transfer between internal register and array carve-out per pseudo Read/Write\n",

        "In the state-of-the-art approach, inversion coding takes place between host memory controller and DRAM, e.g.: Write: encoding in host controller, transmit, decoding in DRAM; Read: encoding in DRAM, transmit, decoding in host controller.",
        "In case system meta data bits (M0 … M15) are used to implement inversion encoding, the DBI bits should be stored in the carved-out memory space.",
        "Encoding as well as decoding is done on host controller side: Write: encoding in host controller, transmit, copy DBI bits into carved out memory space; Read: read DBI bits from carved out memory space, transmit, decoding in host controller.",
        "The trade-off of the approach proposed on the previous slide is that other usages of the Meta Data bits are not possible anymore.",
        "This can still be feasible because, for example, Link ECC/EDC with retransmission, array ECC inside the DRAM and other proprietary or standard JEDEC RAS features might already provide enough protection for the DRAM.",
        "In case a 2nd meta data function (e.g. system ECC/EDC) is still required, it would be possible to split the Meta Data bits (M0 … M15) between bits for the 2nd meta data function and DBI encoding information.",
        "In the JEDEC implementation, 16 data bits are used to encode 1 DBI bit. To implement bus inversion for all 256 data bits, 16 DBI bits are, hence, required.",
        "In case a 2nd meta data function is required together with inversion encoding, 32 data bits could, for example, encode 1 DBI. Only 8 DBI bits would be needed then, and the remaining 8 bits could be used for a 2nd meta function.",
        "This can be used in a flexible way, using n bits DBI bits and 16-n bits for the 2nd meta data function."
