        "The trade-off of the approach proposed is that other usages of the Meta Data bits are not possible anymore.",
        "This can still be feasible because, for example, Link ECC/EDC with retransmission, array ECC inside the DRAM, and other proprietary or standard JEDEC RAS features might already provide enough protection for the DRAM.",
        "In case a 2nd meta data function (e.g. system ECC/EDC) is still required, it would be possible to split the Meta Data bits (M0 … M15) between bits for the 2nd meta data function and DBI encoding information.",
        "In the JEDEC implementation, 16 data bits are used to encode 1 DBI bit. To implement bus inversion for all 256 data bits, 16 DBI bits are required.",
        "In case a 2nd meta data function is required together with inversion encoding, 32 data bits could, for example, encode 1 DBI. Only 8 DBI bits would be needed then, and the remaining 8 bits could be used for a 2nd meta function.",
